## Demo
[Try it out](https://hacklover.net/client), just open the terminal and type "wolf3d"

## Overview
This module is an iframe that loads the original Wolfenstein 3D game using the [js-dos](https://github.com/caiiiycuk/js-dos) emulator. 
I chose to put Wolf3D in an iframe to keep OWD's code and resources lean, especially after closing the window.  

You can potentially create new modules and load different games simply by changing the path of the iframe.

## Quick install
- Copy the content of the `client` module folder into `owd-client/src/modules/wolf3d`
